Tarot Game Rules:

0. Tarot Game is a three to five player game, no more, no less.
   Always deal to a player card vertical to player.

1. Order all cards (1 - 78).

2. Separate Major Arcana from Minor Arcana.

3. Shuffle all Minor Arcana together, 1st half in right hand reversed, 2nd half upright, both sides face down.

4. Deal all Minor Arcana cards out to all players.

5. Shuffle all Major Arcana together, 1st half in right hand reversed, 2nd hand upright, both sides face down.

6. Deal all Major Arcana cards out to all players.

7. Each player shuffles all Arcana cards together, maintaining dealt orientation.

8. Each player places their shuffled deck to their right hand side.

9. Each player draws seven cards, pulling card off deck toward themselves.
   The side your hand touches in the draw is the top side.
   Maintain orientation of cards in your hand at all times.

10. Each player agrees on who goes first.
    The first player plays any card from their hand, top side facing away from you.
    Play continues to the left, until all cards have been played.

11. Play happens as follows:
    All cards in Tarot have supports and oppositions.
    That list of details can be found at: https://tarotx.net/
    After the first card is played, a player has two real options.
    First, play a card that either supports or is supported by the previous card, in any faceup square orientation you choose.
    Second, play a card that either opposes or is opposed by the previous card, in any faceup square orientation you choose.
    Play continues until the last card is played.
    The result of the last card is the result of the game.
    No objections can be made to the result of the game UNLESS a player has broken any of the above rules.



Body reading notes:
between every shuffle, take one half of the cards and invert their orientation, 
to maintain a certain number of reversed cards.



French Tarot strategy notes:
The Taker has one of two decisions to make before game starts...
1. they put their lowest face cards into their discard pile
2. they put their lowest normal cards into their discard pile
Both decisions are significant strategy-wise and narrative-wise.
3. The default choice made will be discarding the lowest normal cards to the discard pile.



Three part novel builder logic:
Part 1 - beginning of story
Part 2 - first round with a trump played
Part 3 - first round with three (or two) trumps played



Game setup notes:
for three players, there are 24 rounds of play, six card dog
for four players, there are 18 rounds of play, six card dog
for five players, there are 15 rounds of play, three card dog

In terms of narrative structure:
Act 1: (2, 3, 3)
Act 2: (2, 3, 3)
Act 3: (2, 3, 3)
for three players,

Act 1: (2, 2, 2)
Act 2: (2, 2, 2)
Act 3: (2, 2, 2)
for four players,

Act 1: (1, 2, 2)
Act 2: (1, 2, 2)
Act 3: (1, 2, 2)
for five players.
