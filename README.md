Tarot Game Rules:

0. Tarot Game is a three to five player game, no more, no less.
   Always deal to a player card vertical to player.

1. Order all cards (1 - 78).

2. Separate Major Arcana from Minor Arcana.

3. Shuffle all Minor Arcana together, 1st half in right hand reversed, 2nd half upright, both sides face down.

4. Deal all Minor Arcana cards out to all players.

5. Shuffle all Major Arcana together, 1st half in right hand reversed, 2nd hand upright, both sides face down.

6. Deal all Major Arcana cards out to all players.

7. Each player shuffles all Arcana cards together, maintaining dealt orientation.

8. Each player places their shuffled deck to their right hand side.

9. Each player draws seven cards, pulling card off deck toward themselves.
   The side your hand touches in the draw is the top side.
   Maintain orientation of cards in your hand at all times.

10. Each player agrees on who goes first.
    The first player plays any card from their hand, top side facing away from you.
    Play continues to the left, until all cards have been played.

11. Play happens as follows:
    All cards in Tarot have supports and oppositions.
    That list of details can be found at: https://tarotx.net/tarot-card-meanings/rider-waite/
    After the first card is played, a player has two real options.
    First, play a card that either supports or is supported by the previous card, in any faceup square orientation you choose.
    Second, play a card that either opposes or is opposed by the previous card, in any faceup square orientation you choose.
    Play continues until the last card is played.
    The result of the last card is the result of the game.
    No objections can be made to the result of the game UNLESS a player has broken any of the above rules.



Body reading notes:
between every shuffle, take one half of the cards and invert their orientation, 
to maintain a certain number of reversed cards.



French Tarot strategy notes:
The Taker has one of two decisions to make before game starts...
1. they put their lowest face cards into their discard pile
2. they put their lowest normal cards into their discard pile
Both decisions are significant strategy-wise and narrative-wise.
3. The default choice made will be discarding the lowest normal cards to the discard pile.



Three part novel builder logic:
Part 1 - beginning of story
Part 2 - first round with a trump played
Part 3 - first round with three (or two) trumps played



Game setup notes:
for three players, there are 24 rounds of play, six card dog
for four players, there are 18 rounds of play, six card dog
for five players, there are 15 rounds of play, three card dog

In terms of narrative structure:
Act 1: (2, 3, 3)
Act 2: (2, 3, 3)
Act 3: (2, 3, 3)
for three players,

Act 1: (2, 2, 2)
Act 2: (2, 2, 2)
Act 3: (2, 2, 2)
for four players,

Act 1: (1, 2, 2)
Act 2: (1, 2, 2)
Act 3: (1, 2, 2)
for five players.



Use a five card spread to create a Story Unit Reading, which corresponds to:
1. Inciting Incident
2. Complication
3. Crisis
4. Climax
5. Resolution



We will need to design a printable output for all this information, use Google Slides for assistance...



Tarot Game Round Rules Brainstorming:
- Tarot is a 3 - 5 player game
- if Tarot Game is 3 player, then max spread size is 3 (applies to 4 and 5)
- also, if a three card spread, the minimum number of players is also 3 (applies to 4 and 5)
- you can have more players than size of spread (randomly choose players 1, 2, 3 each round from player pool)
- you cannot have less players than size of Tarot Game (cannot have five card spread for four or three players)
- each card in a Tarot Game Round corresponds to which character (in their player position) played the card
- each card played by each player is that character's answer to the Five-Part Story Structure
- each card played represents a scene, owned by the associated character, which also asks the Five Questions
- each chapter is a sequence of scenes equal to the number of players in the round of Tarot, so 3 - 5 scenes
- the number of subplots in a story is equal to the number of face cards played as the Trick in a round (average between 4 and 7)



Story Grid Book Notes:

Ch. 11
- story graph example for Silence of the Lambs
- Six Editor Questions:
1. What's the Genre?
2. What are the conventions and obligatory scenes for that Genre?
3. What's the point of view?
4. What are the protagonist's objects of desire?
5. What's the controlling idea/theme?
6. What is the Beginning Hook, the Middle Build, and Ending Payoff?
- Also think on how this concept applies to acting, jokes, composing and coding.

Ch. 16 
- think of how to abstract Genres into a list of relevant conventions and obligatory scenes, to then make a checklist for our review process 
- (if we cover all the topics in our list, then we pass)
- Genre Five-Leaf Clover (organizes most known Genre categorizations into five expectation groups: Time, Reality, Style, Structure, Content)

Ch. 18
- Story Bell Curve (x-axis: Mini-Plot, Arch-Plot, Anti-Plot; y-axis: Potential Audience)

Ch. 22
- Boiling down both Arch-Plot and Mini-Plot Structure Genres lead to describing "The Hero's Journey"
- Inner Conflict, Personal Conflict and Extra-Personal Conflict
- Focus on the struggle to get objects of desire
- character wants and needs

Ch. 23
- External Content Genres (what characters want)
- Internal Content Genres (what characters need)

NOTE: Remember that Genres are fluid, and can morph into each other at any point in a book

Ch. 25
- Most stories that last a few seasons or over 10 novels require the usage of both External and Internal Content Genres

Ch. 27
- The Foolscap Method is comparable in strategy to the Story Grid Method, and can be used as a "process derivative" if relevant

Ch. 28
- The Foolscap Global Story Grid sheet is a one-page summary of a novel that answers the Six Editor Questions from Ch. 11
- Look to page 114 for the one-page form to fill out
- If you can fill out this one-page form after reading a book, then the book "passes the test"

Ch. 30
- Story Value is categorized as a human experience that can shift from positive to negative, or vice versa
- Walk through the assignment of numerical values to all parts of the Story Value Spectrum (this could be coded)
- "The Negation of the Negation" and how it appears in your story

Ch. 32
- First Person, Second Person, Third Person
- Do not shift too much in the story

Ch. 34
- pages 137 and 138 for definition of Controlling Idea and example description, respectively

Ch. 36
- use this chapter to come up with coded parameters for actual novel structure (pages, words, etc)

Ch. 37
- page 148 is the Kubler-Ross Change Curve For Story
- keep in mind curve proportions: 25%/50%/25% is a standard generalization, and can be played around with

Ch. 39
- BEATS!!! lol, it's beat structure, which also happens to be the same structure for all story components:
1. Inciting Incident
a. Casual
b. Coincidence

2. Progressive Complication
a. Active Turning Point
b. Revelatory Turning Point

3. Crisis
a. The Best Bad Choice
b. Irreconcilable Goods

4. Climax

5. Resolution

- Beats (smallest unit of story) 
-> Scenes (basic building blocks of story) 
-> Sequences (minor life stages in story)
-> Acts (major life stages in story)
-> Subplots (controlling theme amplifiers, useful in long story formats)
-> Global Story (what the author is trying to say)
- every unit of story follows the same five principles listed above

Ch. 42
- Turning Points are little buddies to Progressive Complications
- if decisions and actions are easily reversible, then no story; make sure you can't go backwards easily

Ch. 53
- Be aware of Paralysis by Analysis, which is planning out Global Story before writing anything

Ch. 59
- Use the Foolscap Global Story Grid on two scales: Micro and Macro
- Micro Scale (analyze whole work Scene by Scene, keeping track of all building blocks, pages 236 - 253)
- Macro Scale (analyze whole work overall, keeping track of all building blocks, use one-page form)

Ch. 66
- Combining Micro Scale and Macro Scale Story Grids to make the overarching story grid



Need to incorporate dice rolling into card interpretation:
When deciding on the interpreted answer to each story structure question ->
- roll a d4
- there are 4 independent and valid interpretations of each card, ranging from worst (1) to best (4)
- there are 4 defined directions on a compass: N, E, W, S
- there are 4 defined card placements: upright, onside right, onside left, reversed
- there are 4 defined interpretations of card placement: positive, trending towards positive, tending towards negative, negative
- equate the following: d4 roll == direction == card placement == interpretation == *WORDS*
- What is the most 1 value of the card, which is also asking what is the most reversed meaning of the card?
- do this for all possible rolls for each card
- QED.
You can graph the story progression using the method above and plotting the value shifts!



Notes on Tarot Round usage:
- for 3 player game, there are 24 rounds
- for at least 3 main characters, there are at least 24 chapters
- add chapter 0 for world building, character sheets, etc.
- for one novel, that's 25 chapters
- one novel converted to long-format content is one season of a show
- one season of a show is then 25 episodes, following chapter outline
- repeat for however many seasons you want to exist



Whoever wins the game is the protagonist



*WORDS*:
- This has an elegant equation, taken directly from DBT:
- WORDS = Emotions + Facts + Consequences
- apply this equation to every possible dice roll outcome



TL;DR:
- The first play of the round is the Trick, which means they are the Inciting Incident
- The second play is the Complication and Crisis, which also begins the Defense
- The third play is the Climax, which is the last play of the Defense
- The Resolution is who won the game round
